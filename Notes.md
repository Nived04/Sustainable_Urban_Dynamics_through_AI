**Graph Attention Networks (GATs)**
- **Concept**: GATs are a type of neural network used to analyze graphs by focusing on the importance of connections between nodes.
- **Intuitive Explanation**:
  - Imagine a graph as a network of friends, where each node (person) is connected to others.
  - To predict something about a node, GATs don't just consider all connections equally. Instead, they assign different levels of importance (or "attention") to each connection.
  - The importance of each connection is not predefined; it's learned during the training process using a neural network, allowing the model to adjust how much attention one node pays to another based on their features.
  - The attention mechanism uses **softmax** normalization to ensure that all attention scores add up to 1, similar to distributing a pie fairly among friends.
  - The attention weights are not computed using a simple dot product (as in some other models). Instead, they're learned through a small neural network, often a convolutional one, making the model more flexible and powerful.


**Wasserstein Distance**
- **Definition**: A distance function measuring the difference between two probability distributions using some metric space \( M \).
- **Intuitive Explanation**: 
  - Think of it as moving a pile of dirt from one location to another.
  - Each distribution can be visualized as a collection of vertical strips or bars. The task is to move each bar of one distribution to match another distribution using the minimum effort.
  - This effort required to move the "dirt" from one pile to another is what we call the Wasserstein Distance.
- **Mathematical Expression**:
  $$W_p(\mu, \nu) := \left( \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma(\mu, \nu)} \int_{M \times M} d(x, y)^p \, d\gamma(x, y) \right)^{\frac{1}{p}},$$
  
### Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) Traffic Flow Model
- **Concept**: The LWR model explains how traffic flows on highways by treating it like a fluid (similar to Burgers' Equation).

- **Continuity Equation**:
  - Similar to water in a pipe, the number of cars entering and leaving a road section should balance over time.
  - The **continuity equation** is given by:
    $$\frac{\partial \rho(x,t)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial q(x,t)}{\partial x} = 0$$
    where $$\rho(x,t)$$ is the traffic density (cars per unit length) and $$q(x,t)$$ is the traffic flow (cars per unit time).
  - This equation links the change in traffic density and the change in flow over time and space.

- **Shock Waves**:
  - Sudden changes in traffic, like accidents, can cause sharp changes in car densityâ€”these are called **shock waves**.
  - The speed of a shock wave s can be calculated using:
    $$s = \frac{q_2 - q_1}{\rho_2 - \rho_1}$$
    where $$\rho_1$$ and $$\rho_2$$ are the densities before and after the shock, and $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$ are the corresponding traffic flows.
  - The LWR model describes how these shock waves move through traffic and predicts their impact.
