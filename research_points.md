** the cost of incentivizing is less than the cost of congestion**

**Multiple-Routes Problem **
Given a route network graph 𝐺 = (𝑉 , 𝐸) and a continuous flow of 𝑘 ∈ R≥0 drivers per unit of time between an origin 𝑠 ∈ 𝑉 
and a destination 𝑡 ∈ 𝑉 , we consider routing this flow among 𝑛 ∈ N+ routes such that no driver can choose a quicker route 
as long as no other driver cooperatively changes their route as well and the total number of different routes exceeds 𝑛. 
We call such a state an n-restricted user equilibrium (n-UE). The Multiple-Routes (MR) problem aims to find an optimal 
set of 𝑛 routes such that the overall travel time of drivers in an n-UE is minimized.
