## Sustainable Urban Dynamics through AI : Traffic Optimization, Air Quality and Mobility

**Context:**
Urban areas face challenges related to traffic congestion, air pollution, and inefficient transportation systems. Proactively managing traffic flow, optimizing vehicle movements, and increasing public transport utilization can significantly improve air quality and reduce emissions. Leveraging customer demographic data, behavioural patterns, and public transport data can help design smarter traffic control systems and promote environmentally friendly practices.

**Objectives:**
1.	**Proactive Traffic Control:**  
    - Use AI to analyse customer demographics and predict traffic patterns, enabling dynamic traffic signal adjustments to reduce congestion.
    - Incorporate public transport data to optimize traffic signals and reduce private vehicle usage.
2.	**Environmental Improvement:**
    -	Study customer online orders and optimize delivery routes to minimize additional trips, providing on-the-way pickups to reduce vehicle emissions.
    -	Promote the use of low-emission routes and vehicles.
    -	Encourage the use of public transport by highlighting its environmental benefits and integrating it with route optimization.
3.	**Predictive Road Usage Guidelines:**
    - Develop predictive models to provide guidelines on optimal road usage based on road size, vehicle types, and traffic density.
    -	Provide real-time recommendations to drivers for choosing the best routes to minimize congestion and emissions.
    -	Include recommendations for public transport availability (e.g., ensuring x% of transport capacity during peak hours) to reduce private vehicle congestion.
4.	**Public Transport Optimization:**
    -	Analyse public transport usage patterns and identify opportunities to increase its use.
    -	Provide recommendations to the government and transport authorities on optimal public transport capacity and schedules to reduce traffic congestion.
    -	Promote policies that encourage public transport use over private vehicles.
